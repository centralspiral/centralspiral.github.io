        <p align="justify">According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank">Information theory</a>,  after all statistical information has been extracted from the source, further compression is considered infeasible. Essentially, the prevailing belief is that once we have analyzed the statistics, there is no additional room for improvement. However, it's important to acknowledge that this perspective has certain limitations.
          <br><br>
          Our technology, is based on <em>Universal Codes</em> which can be seen as both a generalized version of Information theory and a practical approximation to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory" target="_blank">Algorithmic information theory</a>. This sets us apart from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lossless_compression_algorithms" target="_blank">conventional compression</a>. 
          Instead of relying solely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon's_source_coding_theorem" target="_blank">Shannon's theory</a> to determine the maximum level of compression possible, our approach  incorporates new mathematical ideas to reorganize the sequence of symbols and achieve a more efficient representation of the data. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_description_length" target="_blank">Minimum Description Length</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_synthesis" target="_blank">Program Synthesis</a>, we generate a <em>rule sequences</em> that can recreate the complete dataset uniquely and accurately in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity" target="_blank">polynomial time</a>. It's akin to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf" target="_blank">code-golf</a>, but for data compression, where we find an optimal way to organize the data, enabling a more compact and efficient representation without compromising the integrity of the original data.
          <br><br>
          We distinguish ourselves from other "companies" that have made bold claims, that merely demonstrate their technology in controlled environments, restricting users from experiencing it on their own devices. You can register at <a href="https://stg-app-compression.spiral.codes/" target="_blank">COMPRESSION SPIRAL</a> to witness firsthand the power of a technology that was once deemed impossible but is now a reality.
        <br><br>       
        At <a href="https://www.centralspiral.com" target="_blank">CENTRAL SPIRAL</a>, our mission is to <em>Empower progress through data compression</em>. We firmly believe that our innovative approach to data compression has the transformative potential to impact various applications and technologies, spanning from storage systems to information transmission and beyond. By unlocking new horizons and presenting unprecedented possibilities in the field of data compression, our technology is at the forefront of revolutionizing data handling.
<br><br>  
We extend a warm invitation to you to join us on this groundbreaking journey and witness the future of compression technology firsthand. Together, let's shape a more efficient and promising digital world, where data is optimized and technology paves the way for a brighter future.
